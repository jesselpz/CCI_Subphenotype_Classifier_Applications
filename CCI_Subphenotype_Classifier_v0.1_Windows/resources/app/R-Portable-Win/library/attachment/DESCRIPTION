Description: Manage dependencies during package
    development. This can retrieve all dependencies that are used in ".R"
    files in the "R/" directory, in ".Rmd" files in "vignettes/" directory and
    in 'roxygen2' documentation of functions. There is a function to
    update the "DESCRIPTION" file of your package with 'CRAN' packages or any other remote package.
    All functions to retrieve dependencies of ".R" scripts and ".Rmd" or ".qmd" files can
    be used independently of a package development.
